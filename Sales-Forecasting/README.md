# E-commerce Sales Forecasting (Machine Learning)

## Project Overview
Analysis of the 'Superstore' retail dataset to forecast future revenue and optimize inventory planning. 
I used Machine Learning (Random Forest) to predict monthly sales trends based on historical data.

## Tech Stack
* Python: Scikit-Learn (Random Forest Regressor), Pandas, Matplotlib.
* Data Viz: Time-series visualization of sales trends.
* Business Intelligence: Identification of high-value products and customer segments.

## Key Insights
* Seasonality: 40% of total revenue is generated in Q4 (Holiday Season).
* Top Category: "Technology" products have the highest profit margin but lower volume than "Office Supplies".
* Forecast Accuracy: The Random Forest model predicted Q1 sales with 92% accuracy.

## Future Improvements
* Integrate external economic data (inflation rates) to improve model precision.
* Deploy the model using Streamlit for an interactive dashboard.
